<h1>
British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science 2024
</h1>

  <p>
The <a href="https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science</a> (BCTCS) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.
  </p>

  <p>
BCTCS 2024 will take place at the University of Bath on 4-5 April, where it will be collocated with the <a href="https://t-powell.github.io/southern_logic_seminar/sls.html">Southern and Midlands Logic Seminar</a>.

<h2>
Venue
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in the Chancellors' Buidling. The <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf">campus map</a> might be helpful if you get lost.
